          <br><b>Sharing Personal Information with NK GROUP affiliates and Non-affiliated third parties</b>
          <br>NK GROUP does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any affiliate or third party for any reason, except as described below.<br>
          <br>NK GROUP may share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested or to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. <br>
          <br>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us carry out certain internal functions, such as account processing, fulfilment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a non-affiliated third party with client information from our database, including your name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address, to help us analyze and identify client needs, notify clients of product and service offerings or conduct general marketing and market research for us. <br>
          <br>NK GROUP also forges partnerships and alliances with non-affiliated third parties which offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant, NK GROUP may share some personal information with these non-affiliated third parties. <br>
          <br>We generally require that all non-affiliated third parties to which we provide your non public personal information agree to keep your information confidential and use such information solely for the limited purpose for which we have engaged them, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, where offers are made to you by non-affiliated third parties, we generally require that they disclose that the offer is being extended because of your relationship with us. We also seek to ensure that these non-affiliated third parties maintain appropriate data security procedures to guard against unauthorized use of, or access to, your personal information. <br>
          <br>When required by law, NK GROUP reserves the right to disclose your personal information to third parties or regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or property. <br>
          <br>If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, for example by clicking on an advertisement on a website owned or controlled by NK GROUP, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and we have no control over the use or protection of information provided by you to, or collected by, those websites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded website or to a linked website, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by that third party.<br>

Note that for joint accounts, an-opt out election made by one account owner of a joint account is applicable to all account owners of the joint account.

          <br><b>Risk Warning</b>
          <br>Foreign Exchange and CFD trading are high risk and not suitable for everyone.  You should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite before making a decision to trade with us.  Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.<br>
          <br>There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of the markets that you are trading.<br>
          <br><b>Margin and leverage</b>
          <br>To open a leveraged CFD or forex trade you will need to deposit money with a account provider as a margin.  Margin is typically a relatively small proportion of the overall contract value.  For example a contract trading on leverage of 100:1 will require margin of just 1% of the contract value.  This means that a small price movement in the underlying will result in large movement in the value of your trade – this can work in your favour, or result in substantial losses.<br>
          <br>Your may lose your initial deposit and be required to deposit additional margin in order to maintain your position.  If you fail to meet any margin requirement your position will be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses.<br>
          <br><b>Market commentary</b>
          <br>Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary, and do not constitute investment advice. The NK Group is not liable for any loss or damage, including without limitation, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information.<br>
